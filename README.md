# easylistadware
The official EasyList Adware filter recovered from the WayBackMachine.
<br>
<br>
EasyList (AdBlock Plus), decided to shut this filter down. But this repository is one of the archive of this filter.
<br>
This repository aims to preserve the original file, so this repository will be edited to present information, but the original filterlist file will never be changed/modified in any way.

Special Note: As this filter is just an archive of the original one. New adwares or false positive fixes will not be applied. This is just for the sake of preservation.
